    Bhutan is a small country in the Himalayas between the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and India.
    
    Besides the stunning natural scenery, the enduring image of the country for most visitors is the strong sense of culture and tradition that binds the kingdom and clearly distinguishes it from its larger neighbours. Bhutan is the only Vajrayana Buddhist nation in the world, and the profound teachings of this tradition remain well preserved and exert a strong influence in all aspects of life. Due to its pristine environment and harmonious society, the tiny Kingdom of Bhutan has been called "The Last Shangrila."
    
    Understand
    Bhutan is a unique country both culturally and environmentally. Perched high in the Himalaya, it is the worldâ€™s last remaining Buddhist Kingdom. It has developed the philosophy of Gross National Happiness; where development is measured using a holistic approach of well-being, not just based on gross domestic product.
    
    It is still termed as a third world country with subsistence farming practiced in much of Bhutan. In broad terms, the land is fertile and the population small. In addition, the current generation receives free education, and all citizens have access to free, although rudimentary, medical care. In 2010, the sale of tobacco products was banned and smoking in public areas was an offense punished with fines. With onset of the pandemic, this law was reversed in 2021 with the new Tobacco Control Act to allow the import and sale of tobacco products to stamp the flow of illegal cross border smuggling of tobacco products [1].
    
    Major sources of income for the kingdom are tourism, hydroelectric power and agriculture.
    
    While traditional culture has been very well preserved, the opening of the country to TV and internet in 1999 has had a major effect, and modern-day culture is mostly centered on bars and snooker halls. As a result, there is very little or no evidence of quality contemporary art, theatre or music.
    
    Culturally, Bhutan is predominantly Buddhist with Dzongkha as a national language (although there are regional variations - such as Sharchopkha, the predominant language in Eastern Bhutan), and a common dress code and architectural style. Bhutanese people primarily consist of the Ngalops and Sharchops, called the Western Bhutanese and Eastern Bhutanese, and Lhotshamphas (Southern Bhutanese), a people of Nepalese Gurkha Origin, respectively. The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of their neighbor to the north, Tibet.
    
    Because of the danger of their distinct culture being overwhelmed by Hindu Nepalese immigrants, some of whom had been in Bhutan for generations, many were expelled or fled as stateless persons to refugee camps in Nepal.</p>
